# schedule-work-day-by-hour

## Description

My motivation in building this project was to create a simple scheduler application that could organize the tasks someone has to complete in a typical 9AM-5PM work day. I wanted to build an app that displayed the current date and had different rows for each block of time during the day. Moreover, I wanted to be able to color code each time block to indicate whether or not that specific time was in the past, present, or future to assist in organizing one's day. Each time block in this app has the ability to intake the user's text and save it to local storage so when the user refreshes the page, their input remains on the page. This app solves the problem of being unable to organize a busy work schedule. It allows the user to easily schedule events and keep track of what they have going on during the day. In this project I learned how to utilize dayJS and jQuery elements to effectively store user input, access the current date and hour, and add class attributes to each text box. Furthermore, I was challenged by this project when my original code was not properly functioning and resorted to using the 'this' keyword to target DOM elements and effectively making my code work. I learned how to go back to the drawing board when my original idea did not function properly. 

## Usage

To use this application, simply enter your hourly events into the corresponding time block. Upon hitting the save button, your input will be stored in local storage and remain on the page if you reload. Make sure that you do not click directly on the save icon, rather the blue area of the button to ensure proper storage. As the hours pass, you will notice that the past hours will turn grey, the current hour will be in red, and future hours and events will be in green. You will also notice that the current date is in the header of the app. Here is a link to the deployed site: https://kendrafitzgerald.github.io/workday-schedule-app/ .
